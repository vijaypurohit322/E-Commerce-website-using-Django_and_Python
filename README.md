# E-Commerce website using Django and Python
Hello All, In this project I've created a basic E-commerce website, to understand the flow of shopping websites/application in technical term. How they use the technology to provide end to end service. In this project, I tried to build a shopping application where user can interact and will be able to search product based on different different filter options, like category, by using custom search engine and from navigation bar. User can add item to their cart and also Increase/decrease the quantity of product, dynamically system will change the value of bill and quantity. If any Item is OUT OF STOCK, then I have write functionality to show item out of box by hiding "add to card" button on such products.
